Welcome to the online, open-source textbook *Learning Ink + Unity*!

This book is designed for those who may not have used Ink, Unity, or any other programming language or engine before with the goal to get you started on creating projects.

It doesn't cover *everything*, but it should be enough to start making things and preparing the way to move on to more advanced projects.

## About This Book

This textbook combines interactive storytelling using [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink) with game development in [Unity](https://unity.com/). You'll learn fundamental programming concepts in C#, explore Unity's interface and tools, and discover how to integrate Ink's powerful narrative scripting into Unity projects.
