# Learning Ink + Unity

Welcome to the online, open-source textbook *Learning Ink + Unity*!

This book is designed for those who may not have used Ink, Unity, or any other programming language or engine before with the goal to get you started on creating projects.

It doesn't cover *everything*, but it should be enough to start making things and preparing the way to move on to more advanced projects.

## *How do I read this?*

This book was written in Markdown and designed to be read on GitHub (where it is [also hosted](https://github.com/videlais/learning-ink-unity)).

A future HTML version is planned, but the current design is for reading it as generated on GitHub through clicking on the chapter links below.
