# Learning Ink + Unity

Welcome to the online, open-source textbook *Learning Ink + Unity*!

This book is designed for those who may not have used Ink, Unity, or any programming before with the goal to get you started on creating projects using the Ink-Unity Plugin! It doesn't cover *everything*, but it should be enough to start making things and preparing the way to move on to more advanced topics and concepts.

The content is divided into three sections: Code Basics, Editor Basics, and Using Plugins and Libraries. The first two sections introduce the concepts needed to better understand the last section. While the book *can* be read in a different order, it is strongly recommended to start with some of the chapters on the code *before* moving over to the chapters on the Unity Editor and finally on using the Ink-Unity Plugin itself.
