# Learning Ink + Unity

Welcome to the online, open-source textbook *Learning Ink + Unity*!

This book is designed for those who may not have used Ink, Unity, or any other programming language or engine before with the goal to get you started on creating projects using the Ink-Unity Plugin! It doesn't cover *everything*, but it should be enough to start making things and preparing the way to move on to more advanced topics and concepts.

The content is divided into three sections: Code Basics, Editor Basics, and Using Plugins and Libraries. The first two sections introduce the concepts needed to better understand the last section. While the book *can* be read in a different order, it is strongly recommended to start with some of the chapters on the code *before* moving over to the chapters on the Unity Editor and finally on using the Ink-Unity Plugin itself.
