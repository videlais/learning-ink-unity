## About this Project

This book project started as part of the *[Unofficial Ink Cookbook](https://github.com/videlais/Unofficial-Ink-Cookbook)*. It was originally part of some planned chapters covering C\# and using the Ink-Unity Integration plugin. At thousands of words, the first draft was more than several other chapters in the *Unofficial Ink Cookbook* combined! It was soon decided a separate project was needed to cover C\#, Unity, and then using the two with the Ink-Unity Integration plugin. Hence the *Learning Ink + Unity* book project was born!
