## Common Styles

This book uses certain styles to highlight different keywords and concepts.

### Emphasis Usage

All objects, functions, and methods are highlighted with **strong emphasis**.

Object properties are highlighted with *emphasis*.

Occasionally, words are highlighted with *emphasis* to show their importance or to bring focus to how topics are used in connection with each other.

### Notes

> **Note:** In more technical chapters, notes are used to bring attention to certain details or explain who code is used in a particular way.

### Reminders

> **Reminder:** In later chapters, reminders are used to reference back to earlier chapters and concepts.

## Code Highlighting

In many chapters, code highlighting is used as part of escaped blocks. Single words or lines appear as part of in-line escaping that appears `like this`.

Multiple lines of code are escaped using its language (Ink or C\#) like the following:

```Text
This is an example of
multiple lines
of code.
```

While GitHub and other code highlighting tools recognize the programming language C\#, the scripting language Ink is not currently recognized. Certain keywords and code usages, therefore, will have color highlighting in C\# and not in Ink.
