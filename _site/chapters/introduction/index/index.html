<h2 id="about-this-project">About this Project</h2>

<p>This book project started as part of the <em><a href="https://github.com/videlais/Unofficial-Ink-Cookbook">Unofficial Ink Cookbook</a></em>. It was originally part of some planned chapters covering C# and using the Ink-Unity Integration plugin. At thousands of words, the first draft was more than several other chapters in the <em>Unofficial Ink Cookbook</em> combined! It was soon decided a separate project was needed to cover C#, Unity, and then using the two with the Ink-Unity Integration plugin. Hence the <em>Learning Ink + Unity</em> book project was born!</p>
