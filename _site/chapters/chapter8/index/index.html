<h2 id="accessing-and-importing-ink-unity-integration">Accessing and Importing Ink Unity Integration</h2>

<p>Open Unity Hub and create a new project. (This project is for testing purposes. Its name can be whatever is most convenient including the default “New Unity Project”.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> As of 2025, the recommended way to install Ink Unity Integration is through the Unity Package Manager (UPM) rather than the Asset Store. The Asset Store version is updated rarely and is not recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="installing-via-package-manager-recommended">Installing via Package Manager (Recommended)</h3>

<p>The easiest and most up-to-date method is to install Ink Unity Integration as a UPM package:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Unity, go to <strong>Window → Package Manager</strong></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>+</strong> button in the upper-left corner</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Add package from git URL…</strong></li>
  <li>Enter: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://github.com/inkle/ink-unity-integration.git#upm</code></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Unity will download and install the package. Once complete, the Ink Compiler, Runtime, and Examples will be available in your project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Alternative Installation Methods:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Manual manifest.json</strong>: Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"com.inkle.ink-unity-integration": "https://github.com/inkle/ink-unity-integration.git#upm"</code> to your project’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Packages/manifest.json</code> file</li>
    <li><strong>OpenUPM</strong>: Visit <a href="https://openupm.com/packages/com.inkle.ink-unity-integration/">openupm.com</a> for OpenUPM installation instructions</li>
    <li><strong>.unitypackage</strong>: Download from <a href="https://github.com/inkle/ink-unity-integration/releases">GitHub releases</a> if you need to modify the source code</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="importing-demo-scenes">Importing Demo Scenes</h3>

<p>When installed via UPM, demo projects can be imported separately:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Package Manager window, select <strong>Ink Unity Integration</strong></li>
  <li>Expand the <strong>Samples</strong> section</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Import</strong> next to the demo you want to use</li>
</ol>

<p>Once loaded, the Ink Compiler, Runtime, and Example scenes will be added to your Assets folder.</p>

<h2 id="creating-example-scripting-component">Creating Example Scripting Component</h2>

<p>In the Hierarchy Window, click on the Main Camera GameObject. This will show its components in the Inspector Window.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In the default layout, the Hierarchy Window will be on the far left and the Inspector Window on the far right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="./NewScript.png" alt="alt text" title="New Script" /></p>

<p>In the Inspector Window, click on “Add Component” and scroll to “Add Script”.</p>

<p><img src="./AddingScripting.png" alt="alt text" title="Adding Scripting" /></p>

<p>Click on “Add Script” and then the “Create and Add Script” button.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Normally, the default name of “NewBehaviorScript” would be changed. However, as this is an example, that step is being skipped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="./ProjectScript.png" alt="alt text" title="Project Script" /></p>

<p>Whenever a new scripting component is added, its C# file is added to the Assets folder. With the Ink Unity Integration plugin installed, it will be the newest file.</p>

<p>Double-click this file to open it in your code editor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> As of 2025, Unity supports multiple IDEs including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Rider. Your default editor can be set in <strong>Edit → Preferences → External Tools</strong> (Windows/Linux) or <strong>Unity → Settings → External Tools</strong> (macOS).</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-CSharp">using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As reviewed in <a href="../chapter6/index.md">Chapter 6 on Scripting Basics</a>, a new behavior script will have two methods: <strong>Start()</strong> and <strong>Update()</strong>. The method <strong>Start()</strong> will be called before the first rendered frame and the method <strong>Update()</strong> will be called every frame.</p>

<p>In order to use Ink and its Runtime classes, it needs to be added to the file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-CSharp">using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
// Add the Ink Runtime
using Ink.Runtime;

public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="loading-a-compiled-ink-file">Loading a Compiled Ink File</h2>

<p>Ink runs <em>compiled</em> files created by Inky or the Ink compiler now added to the project. However, before it can run a file, there needs to be a property added to the file so that it can be used in the Unity Editor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> All serialized fields (public properties or fields marked with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[SerializeField]</code>) added to a script file can be accessed and their values changed in the Unity Editor.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-CSharp">using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
// Add the Ink Runtime
using Ink.Runtime;

public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Add a TextAsset representing the compiled Ink Asset
    public TextAsset InkJSONAsset;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Adding the property <strong>InkJSONAsset</strong> of type <strong><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextAsset.html">TextAsset</a></strong> helps in connecting the text asset from the Project window with the property during the Initialization step of the order of execution for the GameObject.</p>

<p><img src="./JSONProperty.png" alt="alt text" title="Ink JSON Asset Property" /></p>

<p>With the Ink Unity Integration plugin loaded, any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ink</code> files added to the project will be automatically compiled into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.json</code> files. The context menu for the Project window also now has a “Ink Script” option for creating Ink files quickly.</p>

<p><img src="./CreateInkScript.png" alt="alt text" title="Create Ink Script" /></p>

<p>To create a Ink Script file using this functionality, use the Add or right-click menu and then click on “Ink Script”.</p>

<p><img src="./NewScriptFile.png" alt="alt text" title="New Script Files" /></p>

<p>A new file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Ink.ink</code> will be created. After clicking outside of the name, the built-in Ink compiler will automatically produce a new file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Ink.json</code>. It is this file that should be associated with the behavior script.</p>

<p><img src="./NewInkJSONProperty.png" alt="alt text" title="New Ink JSON Property" /></p>

<p>With Main Camera selected in the Hierarchy window (so that its components appear in the Inspector window), drag and drop the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Ink.json</code> file on the “Ink JSON Asset” property.</p>

<p>With the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Ink.json</code> file now associated with the scripting component, any saved changes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Ink.ink</code> file will result in the JSON file being re-compiled. As it is now associated with the scripting component, its content will always be updated.</p>

<h2 id="editing-the-ink-file">Editing the Ink File</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise setup, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ink</code> files are not associated with a program for editing. Double-clicking or clicking the “Open” button in the Inspector window will prompt to pick a program to edit the file.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended to use the <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/">Inky</a> editor for editing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ink</code> files. Inky is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. However, any plain text editor (Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.) can be used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This chapter will use screenshots from Inky. As of 2025, Inky continues to be the recommended editor for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ink</code> files, with features like live preview, syntax highlighting, and issue detection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="./EmptyInky.png" alt="alt text" title="Empty Inky" /></p>

<p><strong>New Ink.ink:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-ink">Hey, there!
</code></pre>

<p><img src="./ExampleInkText.png" alt="alt text" title="Example Ink Text" /></p>

<p>Adding the text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hey, there!</code> in the left-hand side of Inky will show the compiled results on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>Once added, save the file through using Ctrl-S or using File -&gt; Save.</p>

<p>Returning to Unity will trigger the Project window to check for any changes in any existing Ink files. If they have changed, the built-in Ink compiler will re-compile and produce an updated JSON file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Because the JSON file is associated with “Ink JSON Asset” property, it was also always be updated when the scene runs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="setting-up-story-api">Setting up Story API</h2>

<p>With the Ink and compiled JSON setup, the compiled file will be used when the scene starts. However, even with the compiled file associated, one more step is needed. A <strong>Story</strong> object is needed.</p>

<pre><code class="language-CSharp">using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
// Add the Ink Runtime
using Ink.Runtime;

public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Add a TextAsset representing the compiled Ink Asset
    public TextAsset InkJSONAsset;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        Story exampleStory = new Story(InkJSONAsset.text);
        Debug.Log(exampleStory.Continue());
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>Story</strong> object allows for using the Story API. It exposes methods like <strong>Continue()</strong> that load parts of the story.</p>

<p>In the above example, a new <strong>Story</strong> object is created and is passed the <strong>InkJSONAsset</strong> property that is associated with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Ink.json</code> via Unity during its Initialization step.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The property <em>text</em> is used from the <strong>TextAsset</strong> object. This exposes the text content of the associated text asset file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When run, the code will start with the property during the Initialization order of execution.</p>

<p>Next, the method <strong>Start()</strong> is called on the GameObject.</p>

<p>A <strong>Story</strong> object is then created and its constructor method is passed the <em>InkJSONAsset.text</em> property of the <strong>InkJSONAsset</strong> object.</p>

<p>Finally, inside of the <strong>Start()</strong> method, <strong>Debug.Log()</strong> is called with the argument <strong>exampleStory.Continue()</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="./InkExampleConsole.png" alt="alt text" title="Ink Example Console" /></p>

<p>As will be covered in the next chapter, the Story API has methods for loading content from a story (compiled JSON file). The method <strong>Continue()</strong> loads the next chunk in the story. In this example, it will load the current text of the story (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hey, there!</code>) and display it on the Console.</p>
