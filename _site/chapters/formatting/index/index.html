<h2 id="common-styles">Common Styles</h2>

<p>This book uses certain styles to highlight different keywords and concepts.</p>

<h3 id="emphasis-usage">Emphasis Usage</h3>

<p>All objects, functions, and methods are highlighted with <strong>strong emphasis</strong>.</p>

<p>Object properties are highlighted with <em>emphasis</em>.</p>

<p>Occasionally, words are highlighted with <em>emphasis</em> to show their importance or to bring focus to how topics are used in connection with each other.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In more technical chapters, notes are used to bring attention to certain details or explain who code is used in a particular way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="reminders">Reminders</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> In later chapters, reminders are used to reference back to earlier chapters and concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="code-highlighting">Code Highlighting</h2>

<p>In many chapters, code highlighting is used as part of escaped blocks. Single words or lines appear as part of in-line escaping that appears <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like this</code>.</p>

<p>Multiple lines of code are escaped using its language (Ink or C#) like the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Text">This is an example of
multiple lines
of code.
</code></pre>

<p>While GitHub and other code highlighting tools recognize the programming language C#, the scripting language Ink is not currently recognized. Certain keywords and code usages, therefore, will have color highlighting in C# and not in Ink.</p>
