## Windows

### Hierarchy

is a hierarchical text representation of every GameObject in the Scene. Each item in the Scene has an entry in the hierarchy, so the two windows are inherently linked. The hierarchy reveals the structure of how GameObjects attach to each another.

### Inspector

allows you to view and edit all the properties of the currently selected GameObject. Because different types of GameObjects have different sets of properties, the layout and contents of the Inspector window change each time you select a different GameObject.

### Project

displays your library of Assets that are available to use in your Project. When you import Assets into your Project, they appear here.

## Views

### Game

view simulates what your final rendered game will look like through your Scene Cameras
. When you click the Play button, the simulation begins.

### Scene

 The Scene view allows you to visually navigate and edit your Scene. The Scene view can show a 3D or 2D perspective, depending on the type of Project you are working on.

However, any changes made during the runtime mode will not be retained when it ends.
